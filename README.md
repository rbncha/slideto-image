Reveal color image with frame from grayscale upon mouse over using jQuery

Very Simple script to convert color image to grascale automatically.  In mouse over, a frame will slide to the hovered image and reveal the image from grascale to color.

It uses html5 to copy normal image to grayscale. Please make sure your browser supports html5. Normally all modern browsers including IE7+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari supports html5.
